# backup_mysql

To run this script every day at 00:00, you need to add it to the cron job. To do this, follow these steps:

Open a crontab for the current user:

crontab -e

Add the following line to the end of the file to run the script every day at 00:00:

0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh

Here 0 0 * * * means that the task will run every day at 00:00. /path/to/backup.sh is the path to your script.

Save the cron job file and close it.
Now your script will run every day at 00:00 and you can be sure that your data will be regularly backed up.
